# FreeCodeCamp Test: 25+5 Clock

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that fulfills the FreeCodeCamp Test for the 25+5 Clock. The 25+5 Clock, also known as the Pomodoro Clock, is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Adjustable Session and Break Lengths:** Users can set the length of the work session (between 1 and 60 minutes) and the break time (between 1 and 15 minutes).
  
- **Countdown Timer:** The application displays a countdown timer that alternates between the work session and break time.

- **Pause and Reset Functionality:** Users can pause the timer and reset it to the original session and break lengths.
